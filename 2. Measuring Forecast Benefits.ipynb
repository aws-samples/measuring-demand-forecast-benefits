    "\n",
    "It's common for the downstream impacts of forecasting improvement to be complex, and for human decision-makers to intervene between the initial forecast output and the final outcomes that drive business costs or revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean forecast owning teams should give up trying to understand the impact of their investments though: You can start out with simple heuristics, and iteratively refine as you explore the business context. If counter-factual \"what could have been\" analysis is too complex in your case for estimates to be useful, you could explore running live A/B tests to track the difference in real-world value between your candidate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory management is one practical place to start, and in this example we showed some simplistic models for estimating how demand forecasting errors might contribute to increased costs, impaired cashflow, and missed revenue through the stock ordering/production decisions they drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "By progressively building maturity in modelling the end-to-end impacts of forecasting, you can start to unlock other forecasting-related use-cases like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pricing optimization, by analyzing the price elasticity of the demand forecast\n",
    "- Increased decision automation, by building confidence in automated ordering rules over time\n",
    "- End-to-end supply chain optimization, starting to consider lead times and other factors\n",
